  "readme": "# node-dogstatsd\n\nA node.js client for extended StatsD server of [Datadog](http://www.datadoghq.com).\n\nDatadog added new some features(histogram and tags) to their own StatsD implementation.\nThis client is an extension of general StatsD client to work with that server.\n\nMost parts of codes came from [Steve Ivy](https://github.com/sivy)'s [node-statsd](https://github.com/sivy/node-statsd).\nI just added few lines to support datadog's histogram and tags features.\n\nThe name of the package is changed because this isn't really statsd client and should be able to be used with original statsd client.\n\n    % npm install node-dogstatsd\n    % node\n    > var StatsD = require('node-dogstatsd').StatsD\n    > c = new StatsD('example.org',8125)\n    { host: 'example.org', port: 8125 }\n    > c.increment('node_test.int')\n    > c.decrement('node_test.int')\n    > c.timing('node_test.some_service.task.time', 500) // time in millis\n    > c.histogram('node_test.some_service.data', 100) // work only with datadog' StatsD\n    > c.increment('node_test.int', 1, ['tag:one']) // work only with datadog' StatsD\n\n## License\n\nnode-statsd is licensed under the MIT license.\n\n## Error handling policy\n\n* exceptions \"bubble up\" into the app that uses this library\n* we don't log or print to console any errors ourself, it's the toplevel app that decides how to log/write to console.\n* we document which exceptions can be raised, and where. (TODO, https://github.com/sivy/node-statsd/issues/17)\n\nin your main app, you can leverage the fact that you have access to c.socket and do something like:\n(this is the best way I've found so far)\n\n    c.socket.on('error', function (exception) {\n       return console.log (\"error event in socket.send(): \" + exception);\n    });\n",
